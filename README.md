# Ableton Front End Practice

### this is a non responsive webpage made to sharpen my skills and reinforce things I learned while at my bootcamp at code fellows

# Skills Practiced
- CSS positioning
- Flex Box
- Grid
- Web Page Design
- HTML for everybody

# Recap
This project was worked on an hour day for a month which helped me realize how much I depended on structured learning and helping me with discipline on just simply coding every single day and I feel I've grown as a front end developer.
